At the end of this exercise, you would be able to:

1.Install Git on your computer
2.Ensure that Git can be used from the command-line or command-prompt on your computer
3.Set up some of the basic global configuration for Git

1.Downloading and Installing Git
  To install Git on your computer, go to https://git-scm.com/downloads to download the Git installer for your specific computing platform.
  Then, follow the installation steps as you install Git using the installer.
  You can find more details about installing Git at https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git.
  This document lists several ways of installing Git on various platforms.
  Installing some of the GUI tools like GitHub Desktop will also install Git on your computer.
  On a Mac, setting up XCode command-line tools also will set up Git on your computer.
  You can choose any of the methods that is most convenient for you.

2.Some Global Configuration for Git
  Open a cmd window or terminal on your computer.
  Check to make sure that Git is installed and available on the command line, by typing the following at the command prompt:
    git --version
  To configure your user name to be used by Git, type the following at the prompt:
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  To configure your email to be used by Git, type the following at the prompt:
    git config --global user.email <your email address>
  You can check your default Git global configuration, you can type the following at the prompt:
    git config --list

Conclusions
At the end of this exercise you should have Git available on the command-line of your computer.

Exercise (Instructions): Basic Git Commands
Objectives and Outcomes
In this exercise you will get familiar with some basic Git commands. At the end of this exercise you will be able to:

1.Set up a folder as a Git repository
2.Perform basic Git operations on your Git repository

1.Basic Git Commands
  At a convenient location on your computer, create a folder named git-test.
  Open this git-test folder in your favorite editor.
  Add a file named index.html to this folder, and add the following HTML code to this file:
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
      <head></head>

      <body>
          <h1>This is a Header</h1>
      </body>
  </html>

2.Initializing the folder as a Git repository
  Go to the git-test folder in your cmd window/terminal and type the following at the prompt to initialize the folder as a Git repository:
    git init

3.Checking your Git repository status
  Type the following at the prompt to check your Git repository's status:
    git status

  Adding files to the staging area
  To add files to the staging area of your Git repository, type:
    git add .

4.Commiting to the Git repository
  To commit the current staging area to your Git repository, type:
    git commit -m "first commit"
5.Checking the log of Git commits
  To check the log of the commits to your Git repository, type
    git log --oneline
  Now, modify the index.html file as follows:
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
      <head></head>

      <body>
          <h1>This is a Header</h1>
          <p>This is a paragraph</p>
      </body>
  </html>

  Add a sub-folder named templates to your git-test folder, and then add a file named test.html to the templates folder. Then set the contents of this file to be the same as the index.html file above.
  Then check the status and add all the files to the staging area.
  Then do the second commit to your repository
  Now, modify the index.html file as follows:
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
      <head></head>

      <body>
          <h1>This is a Header</h1>
          <p>This is a paragraph</p>
          <p>This is a second paragraph</p>
      </body>
  </html>
  Now add the modified index.html file to the staging area and then do a third commit.
6.Checking out a file from an earlier commit
  To check out the index.html from the second commit, find the number of the second commit using the git log, and then type the following at the prompt:
    git checkout <second commit's number> index.html

7.Resetting the Git repository
  To discard the effect of the previous operation and restore index.html to its state at the end of the third commit, type:
    git reset HEAD index.html
  Then type the following at the prompt:
    git checkout -- index.html
  You can also use git reset to reset the staging area to the last commit without disturbing the working directory.

Conclusions
At the end of this exercise you should have learnt some basic Git commands. Experiment with these commands until you fully understand how to use Git.

Exercise (Instructions): Basics of Node.js and NPM
Objectives and Outcomes
In this exercise you will learn the basics of Node and NPM. At the end of this exercise, you will be able to:

1.Set up package.json file in the project folder for configuring your Node and NPM for this project
2.Install a NPM module and make use of it within your project

1.Initializing package.json
  At the command prompt in your git-test folder, type:
    npm init
  Follow along the prompts and answer the questions as follows: accept the default values for most of the entries, except set the entry point to index.html
  This should create a package.json file in your git-test folder.

2.Installing an NPM Module
  Install an NPM module, lite-server, that allows you to run a Node.js based development web server and serve up your project files. To do this, type the following at the prompt:
  npm install lite-server --save-dev

  You can check out more documentation on lite-server here.
  Next, open package.json in your editor and modify it as shown below.
  Note the addition of two lines, line 7 and line 9.
  {
  "name": "git-test",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "This is the Git and Node basic learning project",
  "main": "index.html",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "npm run lite",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "lite": "lite-server"
  },

  }
}
  Next, start the development server by typing the following at the prompt:
    npm start

  This should open your index.html page in your default browser.
  If you now open the index.html page in an editor and make changes and save, the browser should immediately refresh to reflect the changes.

3.Setting up .gitignore
  Next, create a file in your project directory named .gitignore (Note: the name starts with a period)Then, add the following to the .gitignore file
    node_modules

  Then do a git commit and push the changes to the online repository. You will note that the node_modules folder will not be added to the commit, and will not be uploaded to the repository.

Conclusions
In this exercise you learnt to set up package.json, install a npm package and start a development server.

Introduction to React Native: Objectives and Outcomes
In this lesson you will learn about Hybrid mobile application development. In particular, you will be introduced to React Native. You will also briefly review the Expo framework. At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
1.Explain the salient features of hybrid mobile application development
2.Set up and scaffold a React Native application using create-react-native-app.
3.Learn about the Expo framework way of developing React Native applications.

Hybrid Mobile App Development:
Let us now briefly talk about hybrid mobile app development.
As we already know there are two dominant mobile app platforms, Android and iOS.
Now these platforms, if you wish to double up mobile applications you could go the native way using the native development environments and the native tools to develop applications for these two platforms and their corresponding languages, Java or Cotelin in case of Android and Objective-C or Swift in case of iOS.
Now, this gives you the full ability to access all the features of the native platform in order to make use of them within your mobile application, but of course this means that if you need to develop a mobile app targeting both the platforms, then you need to have two separate code bases targeting each of the two platforms and then do the development in two different languages for each of the two platforms.
Now, the mobile app development community has approached this problem trying to resolve the issue of having to maintain separate core bases.
Instead, the question is, can we do mobile app development using a single cord base but still be able to target both the platforms?
Now one easy approach to take in this case is to use the mobile website as a way of reaching into the mobile platform.
So this is where we allow the mobile device users to use their built in browser to be able to access a mobile site.
Thus the users are able to obtain information directly from the mobile website.
This of course means that their application itself is fully hosted in the mobile browser and with a a slower side being supported by us and this is obviously the slowest way of reaching into the mobile platform.
And also, this approach has very limited capability of reaching into that native device features of either of the two mobile platforms, of course this is improving day by day.
Nowadays using the mobile browser approach you can get access to a lot more of the native capabilities.
Including things like location and even local storage on that mobile device.
But still there are limitations on what you can get access to within that mobile devices themselves.
Now the other approach that people have adopted is to use what is called as the hybrid mobile application development with the WebView being used for this purpose.
Now in this case, with the WebView both iAndroid and iOS have a WebView which is a widget that is part of both the platforms that you can use when you design the user interface for your mobile application.
So part of the screen can be occupied by the WebView widget and once that WebView widget is included in your screen layout then you can easily target the content within the WebView widget using the standard web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
And also even going to the extent of using frameworks like Bootstrap to design the content with responsive approach.
But of course, this approach is too slow compared to the native approach.
And it doesn't get access to all the capabilities of the devices.
Now an example of using this approach would be the ionic framework which also uses the Cordova framework underneath for getting access to the Native device capabilities.
Now interestingly, a lot of the native capabilities can easily be leveraged through the Cordova framework and be able to access that within the WebView of your applications.
Now, so this is the other approach. But again, there are limitations again to using this approach.
Now, looking at this, the mobile app development community design yet another way of reaching into that mobile platform.
What it's called is a compiled, interpreted or a VM Hybrid based approach.
In this case, what we realize is that both Both Android and iOS have a built in JavaScript engine which they leverage for supporting their browsers.
So if we can then leverage this JavaScript engine that is part of both Android and also iOS.
In case of Android it is the V8 engine and in case of iOS it is the JavaScript core.
Now, if we can write our applications using JavaScript but then be able to run this JavaScript application on top of the virtual machine, of the JavaScript virtual machine that is included in both the platforms, then we will be able to get access into the native device capabilities.
There have been many attempts at using this approach for getting access to that mobile device native capabilities.
React native and NativeScript are two such examples of use of this compiled or interpreted or the VM Hybrid approach.
Let's talk briefly about these two approaches, the Hybrid approach with the WebView and the Compiled Interpreted or a VM Hybrid approach in the little more detail in the next slide.
So again, talking about the Hybrid App development approaches.
As I mentioned in the previous slide, you have the WebView approach where you can still use the HTML, CSS and JavaScript to design your user interface and then be able to run this code in the WebView that is included in the layout of your application.
And as I mentioned, ionic plus Cordova, our PhoneGap is an example of this kind of an approach.
Now the advantage of using this is that you get a mobile app which feels native, or at least near native because you can install the mobile app on to the mobile device and so it'll fill part of the mobile devices various applications that are already installed.
And so the user invokes app just like they invoke in native mobile application.
This is contrast to using the mobile web approach where you expect the user to first fire up a browser and then type in the address of the mobile site and then go and actively access the mobile site.
So the WebView approach is already getting closer to a native way of providing access to the application.

Now, again, as I mentioned in the previous slide, the WebView approach has limitations.
Now this is where the compiled,interpreted and hybrid approach has been adopted and in this case we maintain the major code off of an application code base in a single language.
Typically JavaScript, for example, when you use react native or you use a native script.
The code is itself written in JavaScript.
Actually it's the business logic code is written in JavaScript.
Then you get access to the native widgets on the tool platforms to layout the user interface.
Now, exactly how is this done in react native? We will talk about that in the next lecture in this lesson.
So again, as I have already mentioned, React Native and NativeScript are two approaches that use JavaScript as the language of choice for development and then be able to access it in the native device capabilities.
There are other platforms like Appcelerator Titanium, Xamarin, which uses C sharp as an approach for doing development, Embarcadero FireMonkey and many more in the mobile development world.
So again, summarizing, there are different types of frameworks that are aimed to build hybrid apps.
So again, whether you use the WebView approach or the compiled approach that we talked about in the previous slide.
So Frameworks that use HTML5 content to target like Ionic + Cordova or Ionic + Phonegap.
Frameworks like React Native and NativeScript which still allow you to do your application development in JavaScript and then be able to access the Native device capabilities by leveraging the Native UI widgets while doing the user interface layout.
Similarly, you have frameworks like Unity, which is used for doing 3D games environment.
Unity is based upon CSharp or JavaScript as their approach but it is purely targeted at developing mobile games.
Kivy, which is a python based approach and similarily libgdx, which uses Java and more game oriented and targeted at the android platform.
An then you have commercial frameworks like Xamarin or Emcarcadero.
Xamarin using CSharp as the language of development choice.
Talking about the advantages of the hybrid approach, of course you already probably realized that some of the advantages of the hybrid approach you have a single code base.
And you can leverage the existing skips if you are already a well versed JavaScript developer, then doing applications in react native or not a native script is fairly straight forward for you because you can leverage your JavaScript skills for doing development.
In this course we will actually learn about how React Native leverages JavaScript plus the React framework to enable us to double up React Native applications.
Similarly, you have a single code base which enables you to target multiple platforms, Android and IOS in this case.
And thirdly, you have reduced development time and cost because you have a single code base and the fact that you are able to reuse your existing development skills means that you don't need to train originally in three different platforms to be able to target the web and the two mobile platforms for your use.
Also, they provide you with an easy way of targeting various form factors all the way from a web browser in a standard computer using the web technologies, than you can target the tablets and the mobile devices using responsive web design and so on.
And also you can get access to some of the native features on the mobile device.
And also with the ability of local storage both using mobile web, as well as using the WebView approach.
As well as using the compiled approach that we have talked about, you get access to the native storage capabilities on the mobile devices.
Typically you get access to something like a key value storage which enables you to store data on your mobile device itself for providing offline capabilities.
And also, the fact that you are able to develop your mobile app and then be able to release the mobile app on the specific app stores, whether it is the Google Playstore or the iOS or the Apple store, means that you get immediate access to the mobile users that typically download applications from these stores and install on their mobile devices.
So the visibility that you gain by doing a WebView app or a compiled app using either React Native, or NativeScript, or one of the other approaches, means that you are able to reach into the stores and get access to the mobile device as opposed to simply designing a mobile website where you expect the user to actively fire the browser to reach out to your mobile website.
Of course, the Hybrid Approach comes with its own set of drawbacks.
Now of course, as I've been mentioning, there are issues like performance issues that you will encounter.
But for most, typical use cases that you will see, for mobile applications, this may not be a problem.
The performance issues manifest themselves a lot more in cases where you are doing high performance games, or 3D games for your mobile devices.
Now, that is where it may be better off to go native or at least use a gaming engine like Unity for developing 3D games and so on.
The increased time and effort to be able to mimic the native UI feel, look and feel, again this is mitigated significantly with platforms like ionic plus cordova where ionic provides you with a major look and feel capability, and automatically adapts to the native look and feel of the tool platforms.
Similarly, react native and native script, since they are all leveraging the native devices, UI rejects, that UI looks very much like a native application so you would be to tell the difference between a react native application as opposed to a fully native application.
One more downside as I have emphasized, is that you may not be able to get access to all the native device features but again this is becoming less and less of an issue because many of the platforms are able to leverage most of the native device capabilities including things like the sensors built into your mobile devices.
So which means that you would pretty soon hardly see any difference in terms of this particular issue, being able to get access to the native device capabilities.
Now, one minor issue that we need to keep in mind is that when you use the hybrid approach there is that little bit of risk that the Apple store may reject your application, although increasingly we are finding less of a concern in this particular issue, because there are, indeed, a lot of applications that are designed using React Native script.
And Ionic that are already on both the Android, as well as the iOS stores.
So, this may be less of a concern as time goes by.
You will be surprised that many of the mobile applications that you use are actually hybrid mobile applications without you even realizing that they are indeed Hybrid mobile applications.
Take Facebook as an example, it is completely done using react native.
Now where do hybrid approaches shine? In terms of their use cases? Now typically, hybrid approaches are again, as I said, is not suitable for all kinds of applications.
But many use cases for mobile applications. Do not require true native capabilities, so you need to evaluate the target users, and the platforms of choice, and the app requirements, and be able to decide how you approach this platform.
And for many content driven applications like business and productivity applications, enterprise applications, and even media applications.
Like for example Spotify. Can you tell whether Spotify is a native app or a hybrid mobile app? Think about that question.
So, these kind of apps definitely shine by using the hybrid approach. With this quick introduction to hybrid mobile application development, let's delve into React Native in the rest of this course.

React Native:
React Native is described as build native mobile apps using JavaScript and React.
So that is why you need to have good knowledge of JavaScript, as well as React in order to make use of React Native.
This is a real app that is built, of course, using JavaScript.
But then, React actually runs on your mobile device.
It will not look any different from an app that is built using the native approach.
Furthermore, as we develop React Native applications, you will realize that React Native supports something like hot reloading.
Meaning that as you edit your code, the modified version is automatically loaded into your app, and then it'll immediately reflect the changes within your app, as we will see when we do the exercises.
If what React Native provides is insufficient to meet your needs, then you can always go native.
Meaning that you can leverage the native platform by ejecting out of the React Native environment and then be able to do part of the application development using native approaches.
Now that means that you would have to use platform specific code and platform specific features for that purpose.
If you check out the various companies that are using React Native, there you have a small sample of the applications that are built using React Native.
Things that you may not have realized that they are built using React Native.
Let's get started and learn the basics of React Native.
Having quickly paid a visit to the React Native website, let's summarize what we have just looked.
We have learned that React Native is a cross-platform, native iOS and Android app building environment without using web views.
Now, React Native, as you realize, is mainly focused on the front-end.
And also, it uses React plus JavaScript for doing its development.
And also, you get access to 100% of the native APIs via JavaScript.
And then we reuse a lot of packages from NPM, also, in order to get access to the react environment.
And React Native itself is backed by Facebook. And Facebook was the one that is behind React and also, correspondingly, React Native.
And what more proof than to show that Facebook itself uses React Native for its mobile app that all of you are obviously familiar in using to access your Facebook.
Now obviously, you may be wondering, how does React Native actually do its work?
Here, I'll give you a brief, not necessarily a comprehensive view of how React Native actually works, but just sufficient enough for us to understand how React Native works.
The actual details of how React Native actually accesses the native device capabilities and so on is not necessary for us to understand completely.
Because we'll be mainly remaining within the React Native ecosystem while accessing the device capabilities.
So when you go to any native platforms, so you have the entire native platform.
So if you want to target the native platform, obviously, we realize that the only way to do so is to use the native development environment and the corresponding languages for the purpose.
Now in this course, our idea is to use hybrid development using JavaScript as the language of choice.
So we will look at the native platforms, the two native platforms, Android and iOS, the two halves of this entire landscape.
And so how do we target each of these two platforms? So this is where we will understand that Android has the V8 JavaScript engine.
And then iOS has the JavaScript code, JavaScript engine, which is used by the browsers in each of these platforms to run the JavaScript code already.
So we have a virtual machine already that understands JavaScript and is able to run the JavaScript code, so why not build on top of that?
And that is where React Native puts in its bridge into the native environment.
The bridge that taps in though these virtual machines into the native devices capabilities.
And on top of that, we built React Native itself, which is implemented in JavaScript and then partly implemented in native code.
But that part is completely hidden from us. And so we access by writing React Native application code on top of the React Native framework.
And the application code is completely written in JavaScript.
Now when you need to render your user interface in either of the two platforms, then both of these will access the native UI elements, whether it is in Android or whether it is in iOS.
They will access the native UI elements and then leverage them while rendering the user interface for both the platforms.
Now this part is automatically taken care of for us by the React Native platform itself.
And so we can live in the comfort of the JavaScript environment and write our code completely as if we are writing a React Native application and be able to leverage all of the native device's capabilities.
In this context, we will also encounter the Expo SDK, which I will talk about in a little detail in the next lecture, in the exercise.
And then also in a lot more detail in the last module of this course, where we will look at accessing the native device's capabilities in lot more detail.
So how do we get started with React Native development?
First and foremost, you used to go and access and install the React Native development tools.
And we're going to leverage the create-react-native-app command line tool to enable us to do our React Native development.
The create-react-native-app tool sets up the entire ecosystem for our React Native app development.
It sets up all the things, like if you read about React Native, you would hear people mentioning about Babel and then doing transpiling and things like that.
We are completely isolated from that part by using the React Native app, because that sets up this whole environment for us.
And so we are left in the comfort of doing just JavaScript application development.
And that's the reason why I chose to leverage the create-react-native-app way of doing React Native development.
Now once we install that, then we will be able to scaffold out a React Native app by simply saying, create-react-native-app, and then give a project name to that.
And then it'll scaffle out the project directory with the necessary files to get you started in React Native app development.
This is exactly what we will do in the very next exercise that follows this lecture.
And the create-react-native-app leverages the Expo SDK for helping us to setup the environment where we can comfortably do our React Native app development.
And so we will explore Expo SDK briefly in the next lecture, and then also examine it in more detail in the last module.
With this quick understanding of React Native, let's move on to get some hands on experience with development React Native applications.

Exercise (Instructions):Getting Started with React Native
Objectives and Outcomes
In this exercise you will set up the create-react-native-app for scaffolding a React Native starter application on your computer.
Also this will use the Expo framework for React Native app development.
At the end of this exercise, you will be able to:
1.Set up the create-react-native-app for scaffolding a React Native starter application on your computer
2.Use the Expo framework .

1.Installing Yarn
  Yarn is another package manager like NPM, but is better suited and faster to work with for React applications.
  So let us install yarn and use it for building our React applications.
  To install Yarn, you can find the instructions for your specific platform at https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install.
  If you choose not to install Yarn, you can continue to use npm in place of yarn without any problem.

2.Setting up the create-react-native-app
  First install expo-cli to run app using expo:
    npm install -g expo-cli
  To install the create-react-native-app command, at the prompt type:
    npm install -g create-react-native-app@1.0.0 or
    yarn global add create-react-native-app@1.0.0

  If you are installing on OSX or Linux, make sure to precede with sudo.
  Alternately, you can use npm and type "npm install -g create-react-native-app@1.0.0" at the prompt.
  This will make the command line tool for creating React Native applications.
  To learn more about the various commands that this CLI provides, type at the prompt:
    create-react-native-app --help
  To check where your app is installed:
    which create-react-native-app

3.Generating and Serving a React Project using create-react-app
  At a convenient location on your computer, create a folder named ReactNative and move into that folder.
  Then type the following at the prompt to create a new React Native application named confusion:
    create-react-native-app confusion
  This should create a new folder named confusion within your ReactNative folder and create the React Native application in that folder.
  Move to the confusion folder and type the following at the prompt:
  yarn start
  This will compile the project and then start serving the project at the address exp://<Your Computer's IP address>:19000.

  Alternatively:
  To open app using expo-cli:
  expo init confusion
  This will create new confusion folder with react native app inside the folder.
  Move to the confusion folder and type the following at the prompt:
  yarn web
  This will compile the project and then start serving the project at the address exp://<Your Computer's IP address>:19006.
4.Running your React Native application
  Install the Expo client app on your iOS or Android phone and connect to the same wireless network as your computer.
  On Android, use the Expo app to scan the QR code from your terminal to open your project. On iOS, follow on-screen instructions to get a link.
  This provides the best experience for implementing and testing your application on a real device.

5.Running your app on a simulator or virtual device
  Create React Native App makes it really easy to run your React Native app on a physical device without setting up a development environment.
  If you want to run your app on the iOS Simulator or an Android Virtual Device, please refer to the instructions for building projects with native code given here to learn how to install Xcode and set up your Android development environment.
  Once you've set these up, you can launch your app on an Android Virtual Device by running npm run android, or on the iOS Simulator by running npm run ios (macOS only).

6.Setting up a Git repository
  You can initialize your project to be a Git repository by typing the following commands at the prompt:
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial Setup"
  Thereafter you can set up an online Git repository and synchronize your project to the online repository.
  Make sure that the online Git repository is a private repository.

Conclusions
In this exercise you installed the create-react-native-app CLI tool and created a basic React Native project and served up the compiled project to your mobile device.


Exercise (Instructions): React Native Components Part 2
Objectives and Outcomes
In this exercise you will continue to develop the app by adding another component, and understand how you can respond to user interactions with the UI. At the end of this exercise you will be able to:
1.Respond to user interactions with the UI,
2.Implement a hierarchy of components in your app.
3.Use a Card RNE component.

1.Displaying Dish Details
  Add a file named DIshdetailComponent.js in the components folder and add code to it
  Then, open MainComponent.js and update it
  Then update MenuComponent.js
  Save all the changes and do a Git commit with the message "Components Part 2".

Conclusions
In this exercise you added more components and used the Card RNE component.

React Native Navigation: Objectives and Outcomes
In this lesson you will learn about support for navigation among the views in your React Native app using React Navigation. As you will learn, React Navigation supports navigation among views that is typical in mobile apps. At the end of this lesson you will be able to:

Set up your application to use React Navigation based navigation support to enable navigation among the various "pages" of your app
Use React Navigation to design a side drawer for navigation support in your app

  Save all the changes and do a Git commit with the message "Navigation Part 3".

Conclusions
In this exercise we updated the Home component in our app.

In this assignment you will complete the remaining two components, About Us and Contact Us that you will add to the application.
You will use the Card layout that we created in the other pages for displaying the information, and the FlatList to design the pages.

Step-By-Step Assignment Instructions:
Assignment Overview
In this assignment, you will update the React Native app to add the "Contact Us" and "About Us" views.

Assignment Requirements
Task 1:
In this task, you will add the Contact Us view to show the address of the restaurant as shown in the picture below:
Add a new file named ContactComponent.js to the components folder
You should display the address as shown in the image. The address information is provided in the text file Assignment1.txt above.
You can use the Card layout that we used in the other pages to design this page.

Task 2
In this task, you will add the About Us view to show the history and list of corporate leaders of the restaurant.
Add a new file named AboutComponent.js to thecomponents folder.
You will use the Card layout to display the history.
The History information is provided in the text file Assignment1.txt above.
This should be implemented in a functional component named History().
The corporate leadership information is obtained from the leaders.js file in the shared folder.
The information about the leaders is displayed using a FlatList with ListItem as shown below.
This should be rendered in the body of a Card with the title "Corporate Leadership".

Task 3
In this task, you will update the MainComponent class in the MainComponent.js file:
You need to include the AboutComponent  as a Stack Navigator, and then include it within the DrawerNavigator, just as we did with HomeComponent.
This will enable navigation to the About Us view.
You need to include the ContactComponent as a Stack Navigator, and then include it within the DrawerNavigator, just as we did with HomeComponent.
This will enable navigation to the Contact Us view.

Icon Fonts and Buttons: Objectives and Outcomes

In this lesson we will review how icon fonts like Font-Awesome can be used within our React NativeS application.
We will also see the use of buttons in the application.
At the end of this lesson you will be able to:
Use icon fonts in your app
Use buttons in the app

There are many icon font packs that are available that are very popularly used.
Font Awesome is one such popular icon pack.
Similarly, we have Material Icons, IonIcons, and a lot more.
Your React Native application can make use of many of these icon fonts.
Now how do we use icons in our application?
Now this is where the React Native elements provides an icon component which allows you to specify the use of icons within your application.
By default, when you specify a property called name to an icon component, that uses the corresponding material icons.
Now, you can also use a type prop on the icon component to specify other kinds of icon font families,
like font-awesome, material-community, octicon, ionicon, and so on, a big list of icon fonts that are supported by the icon from React Native Elements.
Now we can also use things like the reverse and the raised property on the icons that we use in our application to add a lot of value.
Now, in the exercise, we will explore how to make use of the icon to add icon and icon-like buttons to our application.
The icons themselves, when you use the icon component from React Native Elements, it also supports the onPress on the icon to enable you to interact with the icon.
And you can respond to user interaction.
Buttons in React Native, you can easily use the built-in button component in React Native or you can import other button types.
For example, React Native Elements adds its own kind of buttons, which adds value to the button type in React Native and allows you to define more styled buttons to use within your application.

Exercise (Instructions): Buttons and Icons
Objectives and Outcomes
In this exercise you will learn about using buttons and icons in buttons. Also you will learn how to respond to button clicks. You will also learn to customize the side drawer. At the end of this exercise you will be able to:
1.Add buttons and icons to your app
2.Respond to button clicks within your app
3.Customizing the side drawer in the Drawer Navigation.

1.Displaying Comments
  Open DishdetailComponent.js and update it to display the comments about the dish

2.Marking Favorites
  Furthermore, update DishdetailComponent.js to add a icon Button to mark the dish as a favorite.
3.Custom Drawer
  Next, open MainComponent.js and update it to create a custom drawer
4.Save all the changes and do a Git commit with the message "Icons and Buttons".

Conclusions
In this exercise you have learnt to add icon buttons to your app and also customize the side drawer.

Setting up a Simple Server:

Objectives and Outcomes
In this lesson you will establish a simple server using the json-server node module. At the end of this lesson you will be able to:
1.Set up a simple server that makes data available for clients
2.Access the data from the server using a browser.
3.Use the json-server as a simple static web server.

Exercise (Instructions): Setting up a Server using json-server:

Objectives and Outcomes
The Node module, json-server, provides a very simple way to set up a web server that supports a full-fledged REST API server.
It can also serve up static web content from a folder.
This lesson will leverage these two features to provide the back-end for your React application.
In this exercise, you will configure and start a server using json-server to enable serving your application data to your React application.
At the end of this exercise, you will be able to:
1.Configure and start a simple server using the json-server module
2.Configure your server to serve up static web content stored in a folder named public.

1.Installing json-server
  json-server is a node module, and hence can be installed globally by typing the following at the command prompt:
    npm install json-server -g
  If you are using OSX or Linux, use sudo at the front of the command. This will install json-server that can be started from the command line from any folder on your computer.
2.Configuring the Server
  At any convenient location on your computer, create a new folder named json-server, and move to this folder.
  Download the db.json file provided above to this folder.
  Move to this folder in your terminal window, and type the following at the command prompt to start the server:
    json-server --watch db.json -p 3001 -d 2000 -H 192.168.86.21
    or
    json-server --watch db.json --host 192.168.86.21 -p 3001 -d 2000

    json-server --watch db.json -p 3001 -d 2000 ---> this is not working
    -p flag is for port number and -d 2000 will delay the response from server by 2000s to mimic data coming from actual server over internet.
    port 3001 is given as we have our app already running on localhost:3000.
  This should start up a server at port number 3001 on your machine. The data from this server can be accessed by typing the following addresses into your browser address bar:
    http://localhost:3001/dishes
    http://localhost:3001/promotions
    http://localhost:3001/leaders
    http://localhost:3001/feedback
  Type these addresses into the browser address and see the JSON data being served up by the server.
  This data is obtained from the db.json file.
  The json-server also provides a static web server. Any resources that you put in a folder named public in the json-server folder above, will be served by the server at the following address:
    http://localhost:3001/
  Shut down the server by typing ctrl-C in the terminal window.

3.Serving up the Images
  Create a public folder in your json-server folder.
  Download the images.zip file that we provide above, unzip it and move the images folder containing the images to the public folder.
  Restart the json-server as we did before.
  Now your server will serve up the images for our React app.
  You can view these images by typing the following into your browser address bar:
    http://localhost:3001/images/<image name>.png

Conclusions
In this exercise, you learnt how to configure and start a simple server using the json-server node module.
You also learnt how the server can serve up static web content

Introduction to Redux for React Native:

Objectives and Outcomes
In this lesson you will get a quick refresher on Redux. A detailed coverage of Redux was provided in the React course of this specialization.

Objectives and Outcomes
In this exercise you will set up Redux in your React Native application. At the end of this exercise you will be able to:

1.Set up Redux for your app
2.Create reducers, actions and action creators

1.Setting up Redux
  First, set up Redux and allied packages by typing the following at the prompt in your project folder:
    yarn add redux@4.0.0
    yarn add react-redux@5.0.7
    yarn add redux-thunk@2.2.0
    yarn add redux-logger@3.0.6

  Find out the IP address of your computer.
  On a Mac, go to System Preferences->Network to find the IP address of your network adapter.
  If you are using a Microsoft Windows based machine, you can use the instructions available at http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/find-computers-ip-address#1TC=windows-7 to find your machine's IP address.

  Next, create a file named baseUrl.js in the shared folder and add the following to it:
    export const baseUrl = 'http://<Your Computer\'s IP address>:3001/'

  For example, if your IP address is 192.168.1.121, then the above line should be as follows:
    export const baseUrl = "http://192.168.1.121:3001/";

  Then, create a folder named redux in your project
  First, add a new file named ActionTypes.js in the redux folder, and add code to it
  Then, add a file named configureStore.js in the redux folder and add code to it
  Next, we add the reducers. Add a file named dishes.js in the redux folder and update it.
  Then, add a file named comments.js in the redux folder and update it.
  Next, add a file named leaders.js in the redux folder and update it.
  Then, add a file named promotions.js in the redux folder and add code to it.
  Then, add a file named ActionCreators.js in the redux folder and add code to it.
  Save all the changes and do a Git commit with the message "Setting up Redux".

Conclusions
In this exercise you have set up Redux support within your React Native app.

Exercise (Instructions): Using Redux in your React Native App

In this exercise you will set up the components in your React Native app to connect to Redux and obtain the state information from there. At the end of this exercise you will be able to:

1.Set up your React Native app to connect to Redux
2.Obtain the state information from Redux
3.Dispatch actions to the Redux store to effect changes to the state

Connecting to Redux:
  First, open App.js and update it to enable your React Native app to make use of Redux.
  Then, open AboutComponent.js and update it.
  Then, open DishdetailComponent.js and update it
  Then, open HomeComponent.js and update it
  Then, open MainComponent.js and update it
  Finally, open MenuComponent.js and update it
  Save all the changes and do a Git commit with the message "Using Redux"

Conclusions
In this exercise you have updated your React app to connect to Redux

Exercise (Instructions): Debugging
Objectives and Outcomes
In this exercise you will see the tools available for debugging your React Native application. At the end of this exercise, you will be able to:
1.Set up and use the standalone react-devtools
2.Debug JS remotely in a Chrome window

1.Debugging
  a.Install the standalone react-devtools as follows:
    sudo yarn global add react-devtools@3.2.3
  Start react-devtools by typing react-devtools at the prompt
  b.Furthermore, any console logs that you do within your JavaScript code will be printed out on to the terminal window screen.

  Similarly, the Expo App also exposes a lot of debugging tools:
  Shake your device to open the debugging menu,
  which allows you to reload the application,
  it even allows you to disable the live reload of your code,
  it enables hot reloading and you can see the performance monitor.
  So, I can click on a Performance monitor and then up here I can see the number of frames per second, the UI, the number of frames per second and then in JavaScript the number of frames per second.
  So, this may be enable you to watch to see if your views are being rendered fast enough on the screen.
  Select Debug JS Remotely to run the JS code in a web worker thread in Chrome.
  You can open the JavaScript console to see the console output.
  So, this is one way you can watch the console logs directly in your screen.
  Similarly, you can go to the sources and then in the sources this information will be inside this debuggerworker.js
  So, the JavaScript code itself is running in a background debugging tool here.
  So, we can open this information and then be able to view all the details of the code here.
  The JavaScript part of the code as I said will be running in a thread on your Chrome browser and this would be communicating with the Expo client on the device and then doing all the UI rendering on the Expo client.
  Now, I will suggest you use this only when you need to do some debugging because when you are running the JavaScript part of your application in a Chrome browser,
  this is going to communicate through a tunnel, through the network with your Expo client on the device and then render the UI, and this is going to be significantly slower than what you would expect when the application is running completely on the device itself.
  Running JS remotely will make your app run slow, so turn off remote debugging after you are done.
  That is the reason when you do the remote debugging, you would see this yellow message pop up at the bottom there.
  When you open it it says, "Remote debugger is in a background tab which will cause them apps to perform slowly.
  Fix this by foregrounding the tab and so on." So, you can see this yellow warning box pop up at the bottom there.
  You can dismiss that and then after you have done with your debugging, then you may wish to stop the "Remote JS Debugging" so that your application runs only on the device.
  So, these are some of the tools that enable you to do debugging on your application running on the device.
  If you're not using a real device and instead you are using a simulator, then in the simulator you can type "Command D",
  if you're using on a Mac, you can type "Control D" if you're using it on Windows to pop up the same menu.
  If you're using the Genymotion then you can click on the" Menu" and then the same debugging menu will pop up on your screen.
Conclusions
In this exercise you learnt to use debugging support for React Native.

In this exercise we will add a form to our app, and examine how to handle form submission. At the end of this exercise you will be able to:

1.Create forms in your React Native app
2.Handle form submissions

1.Adding a Form
  First, we will add a Date Picker module to our app as follows:
  yarn add react-native-datepicker@1.7.2
2.We will then add a new file named ReservationComponent.js and update its contents
3.Then, we update MainComponent.js to intergrate the new component into our app
4.Save all the changes and do a Git commit with the message "Forms".

Conclusions
In this exercise we have learnt how to add forms to our app.

Exercise (Instructions): Modals

Objectives and Outcomes

Assignment 2:
In this assignment you will explore React Native Modal and forms, and set up a form to submit a comment about a dish.
You will also set up the appropriate actions, action creators and update the comments reducer for adding the comment to the list of comments for the dish.

Assignment Overview
In this assignment, you will use a modal containing a form that enables you to add your comments about the dish.
When the comment is submitted, then an action is dispatched to add the comment to the list of comments.

Assignment Requirements
This assignment consists of two tasks:

Task 1

Implement a modal containing the "form" that enables the user to add comments on the dish in the Dishdetail Component.
The "form" should contain three fields: Rating, Author and Comment.
Use a Rating React Native Elements (RNE) component for the Rating, and RNE Input component for the Author and Comment fields.
The Rating should be configured with a range of 1 to 5 with a step size of 1.
The form component values should be stored in the state of the Dishdetail Component.
Upon submitting the valid comment, the comment should join the other comments for the dish in the Dishdetail component.
This would be implemented through the steps in Task 2 where you set up the Redux store to allow you to add the comment.
The dispatch of the action should be done in the handleComment() function that handles the form submission in code.
Add an icon to the Card displaying the dish, which when clicked, will show the modal.
The icon should use the Font Awesome pencil icon.

Task 2
Add an Action named ADD_COMMENT to the ActionTypes.js.
Add two action creators named postComment() and addComment().
The postComment() creator will receive the dishId, rating, author and comment as the four parameters.
The date for the comment should be set automatically upon submission of the form.
You can use the JavaScript date (see here for an example) method to set the date to ISO string.
It will delay for 2 seconds and then dispatch addComment().
Update the comments reducer function to handle the new ADD_COMMENT action and add the comment to the list of comments.
The handling of the action should also ensure that appropriate ID will be added to the comment.

2.Add animations to your applications using Animatable

Exercise (Instructions): Animations

Objectives and Outcomes
In this exercise you will learn to add animations to your app using the Animated API supported in React Native. At the end of this exercise you will be able to:
Add animations using the Animated API to your app
The animated API provides us with quite a flexible way of adding animations to our application.
We will see in this exercise how we can add animations by transforming certain properties as a function of time using the animated API.

1.Animations
  Open HomeComponent.js and update it
  Save all the changes and do a Git commit with the message "Animations".

Conclusions
In this exercise you learnt to add animations using the Animated API.

Exercise (Instructions): Animatable

1.Set up your app to use react-native-animatable
2.Apply pre-packaged animations to some elements

1.Using react-native-animatable
  First install react-native-animatable in your app by typing the following at the prompt:
    yarn add react-native-animatable@1.2.4
  Then, open AboutComponent.js and update it
  Next, open ContactComponent.js and update it
  Then, open DIshdetailComponent.js and update it
  Next, open FavoritesComponent.js and update it
  And Finally open MenuComponent.js and update it
  Save all the changes and do a Git commit with the message "Animatable".

Conclusions
In this exercise you have learnt to use the react-native-animatable to add animations.

Gestures: Objectives and Outcomes

The user performing gestures is a very natural way for the user to interact with your mobile application on a mobile device.
So, typically, the user may swipe on the screen, may do multi touch on the screen, may do a rotating kind of operational screen and so on.
So all these result in gestures being done on the screen to which your app may wish to respond to handle these gestures by the user.
Now in terms of implementing gesture handling the best practices suggest that you give some visual feedback to the user to show what's handling the touch.
So for example if the user is pressing on a button, maybe you will slightly enlarge the button and darken the background of a button or maybe do a little effect as done in Android with the material design approach.
Also, you should be able to support cancelling of a gesture if required.
In this lesson you will explore the support for gestures using PanResponder in a React Native app.
The PanResponder is also part of React Native and the PanResponder exports in API which can be easily used for this purpose.
Now, it provides a predictable wrapper with a set of response handlers, which are implemented. And this enables you to take advantage just of the responder system underneath.
It provides native event and gestureState as parameters to the various handlers that you implement.

At the end of this lesson you will be able to:

Make use of PanResponder to respond to various user gestures on the screen

Exercise (Instructions): Gestures Part 1

Objectives and Outcomes
In this exercise you will learn to use the PanResponder to add gesture support in your app.
At the end of this exercise you will be able to:
1.Use the methods supported by PanResponder to add gesture support in your app

1. Using PanResponder
  Open DishdetailComponent.js and update it
  Save all the changes and do a Git commit with the message "Gestures Part 1".

Conclusions
In this exercise you learnt to use the PanResponder to add gesture support to your app.

Exercise (Instructions): Gestures Part 2
Objectives and Outcomes
In this exercise we will continue with the use of PanResponder to respond to gestures.
In addition we will add in animation as a way of giving visual feedback to the user.
For that we will use animatable module that we have already installed.
At the end of this exercise you will be able to:

Use animations as a way of giving visual feedback to users in response to gestures

1.Animations and Gestures
  Open DishdetailComponent.js and update it
  Save all the changes and do a Git commit with the message "Gestures Part 2".

Conclusions
In this exercise you saw the use of animations as a way of providing visual feedback to users in response to gestures.

Persist Redux Store: Objectives and Outcomes

The state of our Redux store is reset when we restart our application.
In this lesson you will learn to persist the Redux store to storage and rehydrate the state from the persisted information in storage.
At the end of this lesson you will be able to:

1.Persist the state of your Redux store
2.Rehydrate the state from the persisted store

Redux-Persist enables you to persist your Redux state into the persistent storage on your device between application launches.
Redux-Persist provides a persistCombinedReducers, which takes multiple reducers and then produces the corresponding combined reducer.
The persistCombinedReducer takes as its first parameter a config, which is a JavaScript object.
Within the config object, we specify the particular storage that we want to use for persisting the storage, we specify a key, and some additional information, which parts of the state to persist, and whether you want to not persist certain parts of your Redux store, and so on.
So, all these can be configured in the configuration object.
Now, we can use different kinds of storage for persisting our state in our device.
By default Redux-Persist uses local storage.
We can use session storage, we can use AsyncStorage that comes with Redux store, you can even use secure store, and any other storage, or even persisted into files on the device if you so choose to.
When you configure Redux-Persist, you pass the store to persist store, which then ensures that your Redux state is saved to the persistent storage every time the state changes.
So, this is automatically done for you by Redux-Persist.
Once you put Redux-Persist into place with your Redux store, then how do you integrate that into your React application?
So, this is where the Redux-Persist provides its own integration mechanism for integrating the Redux-Persist with your React application.
Within your React Native application, or your React application, you wrap your root component using PersistGate, which is exported by Redux-Persist,
and this PersistGate when applied to wrap your root component, then the PersistGate will delay the rendering of the UI until the Redux store is rehydrated from that persistent store.
So in this case, if there is a short delay for updating the Redux store from the persistent storage, then the PersistGate takes a loading component as one of the parameters, and then uses that loading component and displays that loading component on the screen.
We have already configured our React Native application with the loading component, so we can just pass that in as one of the props for persist store, and that will automatically ensure that the loading component is displayed while your Redux-Persist is rehydrating your Redux store.
With this quick understanding of Redux-Persist, let's move on to the exercise, where we will configure our React Native application to make use of Redux-Persist.
Now, in this course, I am using the basic essentials from Redux-Persist.
It is lot more powerful, and you can use a lot more of the advanced features, once you get comfortable using Redux-Persist.
Redux Persist itself can be used even with a React web application if you so choose to.
But typically the persistence across app restart is more of the concern in a mobile application, than a web application.
Typically for a web application we assume that we are connected to the Internet and we should be able to refresh the state of the application.
But with a mobile device you may be off the network sometimes.
And you may still, when you restart your app, at least you want to give the user at least a minimum user experience with minimum amount of information displayed within your app.
So this is where the persistence of the Redux tool enables you to add in offline support for your application automatically.

Exercise (Instructions): Persist Redux Store

Objectives and Outcomes
In this exercise you will learn to use redux-persist to persist the state of your Redux store, and rehydrate it when you restart your app. At the end of this exercise you will be able to:
1.Set up and configure redux-persist
2.Persist your store and rehydrate on restart of the app

1.Persist Store
  First, install redux-persist by typing the following at the prompt:
    yarn add redux-persist@5.9.1
    note: newer version of redux-persist is throwing error so use this version
  Then, open configureStore.js and update it.
  Then, open App.js and update it.
  Save all the changes and do a Git commit with the message "Persist Redux Store".

Conclusions
In this exercise you learnt to persist the Redux store and rehydrate it upon restart.


Assignment 3:
Alerts, Animations, Gestures, and Persist Redux Store:

In this assignment you will explore the addition of Animations, Gesture recognition and Alerts.
You will animate the appearance of the reservation form.
When the reservation form is submitted, you will show an alert to ask the user to confirm or cancel the reservation request.
You will also add a gesture to the Dishdetail component that will pop up the comment form when the user performs the gesture on the screen.

Assignment Overview
In this assignment you will be working with the Reservation Component and the reservation form within the view.
You will add animations to the form.
When the user submits the form, you will pop up a confirmation alert.
Also you will add another gesture support to Dishdetail component.

Assignment Requirements
This assignment consists of three tasks:

Task 1
You will add a zoom in animation using the Animatable.View to the reservation form in the Reservation component. When the user opens the Reservation view, the form will zoom in to the page as illustrated in the video.

Task 2
When the user fills the reservation form and submits the form, then you will pop up a confirmation Alert with two options: Cancel and OK, as shown in the screenshot below. You will remove the modal that we had added in an earlier exercise to show the details of the form.
The submitted information should be displayed as shown below:
If the user clicks on the Cancel option, then you will reset the form.
If the user clicks on the OK option, you will also reset the form. Additional steps will be added in the exercises in teh next module.

Task 3
Add support for a left to right gesture in the Dishdetail component. When the user swipes from left to right, then you should open the modal containing the comment form.
To do this, implement a new function named recognizeComment() that is passed in the gesture state as the parameter. It then recognizes and returns true if the left to right gesture is done, false otherwise.
Use this function in the PanResponder methods to toggle the showing of the comment form modal.


The Expo SDK:

Objectives and Outcomes
In this lesson we will get a brief introduction to the Expo SDK and how it enables us to access the native capabilities of mobile devices. At the end of this lesson you will be able to:
1. Understand the salient features of the Expo SDK
2. Evaluate how the Expo SDK enables us to access the native device capabilities

The Expo SDK itself is a free and open source tool chain that is built to support development of React Native applications.
That Create React Native App that we installed and scaffolded out our application makes use of the support of the Expo tool chain.
We have been using the Expo client already for viewing our React Native application on the mobile device.
So, we already have some initial introduction to the expo toolset and made use of some of the tools already.
But Expo, in addition, also provides a Native JavaScript based library that provides access to many of the device's Native functionality.
Things like the camera, the contacts, the local storage, the calendar, sensors and many more.
Now, if you are developing a React Native application, you are obviously going to expect that at some point in time, you would need access to the Native devices capabilities.
Now, there are many ways of going about achieving this.
You could develop the React Native App, and then go on to add in the Native device functionality by using pure Native code, and then plugging it into your React Native App, and then leverage that from within your React Native apps JavaScript code.
Now, of course, that is the cumbersome approach to adopt in this case.
The Expo SDK package has a whole bunch of Native device access capabilities into a easy-to-use software development kit, which we can then leverage to access the Native devices capabilities from the comfort of JavaScript.
So, we are completely freed from having to concern ourselves about how to write Native code.
That is already taken care of by the Expo SDK.
Now, of course, there are limitations which I'm going to talk about it at the end of this lecture, but the important thing to note is that the Expo SDK provides a convenient packaging of the access to the Native devices capabilities.
Indeed, you can develop many React Native applications using simply the functionality that the Expo SDK provides for us.
The Expo toolset provides a set of UI components that take care of several use-cases.
It gives us access to icons, which in turn we have actually made use of within the React Native elements, and also we used the icons in several places within our application already.
Similarly, the Expo SDK makes use of blur views, which we didn't use in this course.
I haven't found a specific use-case for that, and so, we haven't applied that.
In addition, the Expo also provides several other UI components that are useful for your application.
Not just that. As I said, in this module, we are going to examine the use of the Expo SDK for accessing the Native device capabilities.
Also, the Expo environment provides services for apps.
Things like managing assets, supporting push notifications, building Native binaries for deployment on the real device.
So far, we haven't talked about how we would actually build an APK for our Android application, or build the application for putting on the App Store to be made available for our iOS devices.
But the Expo toolset provides a convenient way where you don't even need to install any of the Native development tools like Xcode or Android Studio in order to build your application for deployment on the Native device.
We will explore that briefly towards the end of this module.
But the factOf course, there are use-cases where you may really need to drop-down into Native code, but that would be far and few in between for many applications that you would normally develop using React Native.
The Expo client itself, we have explored that in a lot of detail in this course. We have actually leveraged that in order to examine our React Native application, and then view the changes as we make changes to our React Native application.
We have been able to wirelessly serve our application to the device, and then view the application on the device.
So, that we have already done extensively in this course. In addition, the Expo toolset also provides a command line interface for doing development.
If you are uncomfortable with using the command line interface, then Expo also provides an Expo Development Environment or the XDE, if you so choose to.
The create-react-native-app that we have been using has helped us to get us all the way up to this point, and then we would see that even the exercises in this course, we can easily do simply remaining with create-react-native-app.
We won't actually drop into using the XDE at this moment.
The only time where we may need to resort to using the CLI or the XDE in this course is when we need to do the building of the binaries for the two data platforms, iOS and Android, which we'll look at at the end of this module.
Now, obviously in your mind, you would probably have this question. How is Expo related to the create-react-native-app that we have been using so far?
How do they interact? Can I move from an app that I developed using create-react-native app (CRNA) back into Expo, and then make use of it and so on?
Indeed, what you scaffolded out with the create-react-native-app, CRNA for short, you have been using Expo without doing any further configuration.
With CRNA, you don't really need an Expo account. But if you want to build the binaries, then you would register for an Expo account.
Once you register for an Expo account, the Expo account allows you to publish your project with the public URL so that anybody over the Internet can download and use your React Native application.
So far, we have been able to connect with the server that we have been running using yarn start in our computer, and then we have been able to wirelessly connect, provided the Expo client is used within the same wireless network as your computer.
So, your computer is using something called ngrok in order to be able to serve up your React Native application, and then we're able to to access that using the Expo client on our mobile device and being able to do that.
But suppose you want to distribute your React Native based mobile application to other users.
Then the Expo account provides you a way of making your application available at a public URL, which people can then access.
And then- Access and download it into their device using an Expo client and be able to make use of your React Native application on their devices.
It also allows you to build binaries for, as I said, the App Store or the Play Store distribution without using the Expo account.
If you wish to do that with create-react-native app, then you will have to eject out of the CRNA, and then use the native tools, Xcode or Android Studio, in order to further do the development.
So, if you don't want to use the Expo account, and use the online way of generating the binaries, then you always have the other path where you can use the native development tools on your device.
But be warned that if you have a Windows computer, you can only use that path for developing for Android devices.
You need a Mac with Xcode installed if you want to do development for an iOS device.
But also, there will be situations where you may have a special case, where Expo may not provide the support for accessing some of the native devices capabilities, or you don't have access to that.
In those special circumstances, you have no other choice but to eject out of this, and that is very straight forward.
Once you eject out of CRNA, then whatever you use for make Expo SDK Gits package into the ejected application, and you can continue to use the Expo API without any problem at all.
So, that's something that you can easily remain with.
No Again, I take everything that is said on the internet with a big rock of salt, and not just a grain of salt.
Again, your mileage may vary. So, I will leave you with that message at that point. To me, we have already found a way of being able to master react-native-application development without ever having to go down into the native environment all the way so far.
And you have all the skills that you need for doing react-native-application development within the comfort.
There is always that going beyond what we have learnt. That I will leave it as an exercise for you to pursue after you get sufficient experience doing react-native-application development using the Expo environment that we have been using so far.
Again, as a beginner, my intention is to get you quickly over that initial hump of the ramping up to being able to develop react-native-applications, but then there is always that law of diminishing returns where those extra skills that you need to to acquire in order to be able to do those minute little details that cannot be done with Expo, that I will leave that as an exercise for you after you get out of the create-react-native-application environment.
Now, as I said, Expo does have limitations. Let's be honest and explore those issues.
For many applications that you develop, these may not be of much concern, but there would be always that special case where you need to go beyond, and that is the situation that we should be fully aware of before we move forward.
So, what does Expo restrict you to, or what are the limitations of the Expo approach for development?
So, this information is directly from the Expo site.
So, they themselves honestly tell you what cannot be done using Expo, at least at this moment.
The first thing is that Expo apps don't support background code execution at this moment. So, doing things in a background thread is not supported.
But again, there are situations where you may need that, but in most simple applications, that is not much of a concern.
Secondly, not all iOS and Android APIs, the native APIs, not all of them are available in Expo.
For example, if you need access to Bluetooth to be able to connect to an IoT device or something like that, those are special cases where you really need to get those additional skills to be able to do that.
This course is not meant for that. We are looking at getting a basic react-native-application with many capabilities indeed, out, still remaining within the JavaScript environment.
Third point, if you need to keep your app size extremely lean, then Expo may not be the best choice because the Expo SDK adds in its own code for supporting your application.
If that becomes an issue for you, then maybe Expo is not suited for you.
Most recent mobile devices, that is not a big issue at all. If you are targeting a mobile device from like, say five or six years ago, then maybe that may be an issue because of the memory limitations there, but most modern devices, you can get away with using Expo without much of a problem.
If you want to use a particular push notification service that you need to leverage within your application, and you're not happy with what the Expo SDK already exposes for you, then maybe it is time to jump out of Expo.
Again, even with Expo, you can do a lot of the development at the point where you encounter the limitation, you can eject out of Expo packaging whatever you have done, and then move out into native development at that point.
That JS and assets managed by Expo require access to the Google Cloud Platform and AWS in situations.
We have actually not used this in the application that we are developing in this course so far, so that is not much of a concern, and even without that, we have been able to get this far developing a pretty useful react-native application.
So, again, these are limitations that you need to keep in mind as you go further in developing your react-native-application.
Having said all this, let's now explore some of the APIs that Expo provides for enabling us to access the native devices capabilities.
We'll look at the use of local notifications, we can even do push notifications if you require using Expo where we're going to look at the use of secure storage on the mobile device, then we will look at the use of being able to share information from your mobile device either through email or to any of the social media accounts.
Then we'll look at how we can access the camera, as well as the photo gallery on our device to be able to get an image from there, and then use it within our application, and we'll look at how we can access the network information and so on.
I haven't explored the use of the sensors and the location aspects of the device. That is a little bit advanced for this course, but even that, you can do still remaining within the Expo SDK and the Expo environment.
That is one step beyond what this course is expected to cover, but when I get a chance, I will explore some of those and maybe post some blog articles about how I use them.
I have actually tried them out separately, but I believe that that is too much for this introductory course on react-native.
But if you have interest in that, then there's enough documentation on the Expo site to how you can access the accelerometer, how you can access the location services, maps, and so on, from within the JavaScript environment.

Secure Store:
Objectives and Outcomes

In this lesson we will explore the key-value based storage that is supported in React Native.
The AsyncStorage provides a simple, unencrypted, asynchronous, persistent, key-value storage system that is global to the app.
The Secure store i the Expo SDK provides a way to encrypt and securely store key–value pairs locally on the device.
At the end of this lesson you will be able to:
1.Configure your app to take advantage of the secure store provided by Expo SDK
2.Store and retrieve key-value pairs in the secure store.


Secure Store:
One of the first APIs that we will explore from Expo SDK is the SecureStore API, where we get access to a secure way of storing information on our device using Key-Value pair storage.
The React Native environment itself supports and provides an access to an async store, which provides a simple unencrypted asynchronous persistent key-value storage system.
And you can easily import AsyncStorage within your React Native application, and then make use of it to store data in the form of key-value pairs.
This is global to the application.
And instead of using local storage that typically is used with your web application, we can make use of the AsyncStorage in this case.
Now typically, when you use the AsyncStorage within your React Native application, you would normally build an abstraction around it so you will build a class which uses asynchronous storage inside.
And then export a couple of functions, and then that can then be used by the rest of your application.
Now the AsyncStorage itself on iOS, is backed by Native code that is implemented, that stores small values in a serialized dictionary in your device,
and for larger values, it stores them in separate files.
On Android, the AsyncStorage is mapped into RocksDB or the SQLite database that is built into Android based on whatever is available on your device will be exploited for this purpose.
Now with AsyncStorage, you can do typical get and set operations on key-value pairs, so you can do a set with a key and a value supplied, and then you can do a get with a key and a default value supplied.
And you can clear the data on your device. So there are many operations that you can even do multi get and multi set and so on with AsyncStorage.
Now that is one easy way of being able to leverage the local key-value storage to store small amount of data on your device, useful for your application.
An example of usage of this would be to store settings for your application.

If you want a more secure storage on your device, then the Export SDK supports SecureStore.
This is a storage that encrypts the data that is stored on your device.
It provides a way of encrypting and securely storing key value pairs.
Again, SecureStore also based around the key-value pair approach for storing data and it stores the data securely on your device separately for each project.
So each project will have it's own SecureStore and not accessible outside that particular application.
In iOS, the value is stored using key-value chains using kSecClassGenericPassword approach.
If you know something about iOS development, then that's how the SecureStore leverages the support from iOS to be able to store the data.
On Android, the values are stored in SharedPreferences, where if you have done any Android development then you know how SharedPreferences allow you to do key-value storage.
That is what is leveraged by SecureStore, but encrypted and stored in SharedPreferences.
And this encryption is done using the Android key store system, so that is the way it supports SecureSstorage.
Now typical methods that are supported by SecureStore include setItemAsync, getItemAsync, deleteItemAsync.
All these typically take a key, and in situations where you know to store the data it will take the corresponding value.
When you need to retrieve the data, you'll give the key and a default value. And also takes additional options when you store and retrieve items.
In the exercise, I'm going to leverage the SecureStore for storing data on the device.

In the React Native application, I'm going to create a component called the login component, where the user typically types in the username and a password.
And then checks on a check box called Remember Me, and then logs into the system.
When the user first time logs into the system, if the user checks the Remember Me,
then this username and password information is going to be persistent in the SecureStore on my device.
So when I log in into the system and click on the login, right now I haven't implemented the server site support for log in.
That will be done in the next course.
And when we clicked on the log in, the log in process will be done by communicating with the server.
And then at that point your application will then go to their home component and then display the information with, specifically tailored to the login user.
But if you do that, subsequently, if the user navigates away from this page and then later on if the user opens the application again,
the username and password will be retrieved from the SecureStore and automatically filled in to form there,
or you may even arrange for the application to automatically login the user when the user restarts the application.
As an example here, I'll illustrate that when I go back to the log in page, you can see that the information is still there.
Now to show you that the information actually is stored in the SecureStore, I will uncheck the remember me and login to the system.
When I uncheck that, then the user information is not going to be persisted in the SecureStore.
So now if I login and then go off to another component.
Let me navigate away from here, say to the home component.
And then I come back again to the login component here.
You would now notice that the user name and password is not filled automatically, because we didn't save this information.
So this is an example of the use of SecureStore for securely storing a small amount of information on your mobile device for your application.
And then being able to retrieve and make use of it in the application where required.

Exercise (Instructions): Secure Store
Objectives and Outcomes

In this exercise you will configure your app to make use of secure store from Expo SDK to enable storing and retrieving data in the form of key-value pairs.
At the end of this lesson you will be able to:
1.Configure your app with secure store
2.Store and retrieve data using key-value pairs
In this exercise, we're going explore the use of secure store in order to store the login information for the user within our application.
So we're going to create a form for the user to log into our site, and store the username and password for the user in the secure store.
So that subsequently, the user doesn't need to enter this information.

1.Using Secure Store
  First install secure-store as:
    expo install expo-secure-store
  Add a new file named LoginComponent.js in the components folder and add code to it.
  Then, update MainComponent.js to incorporate the LoginComponent.
  Save all the changes and do a Git commit with the message "Secure Store".

Conclusions
In this exercise you will learn to use the secure store from Expo SDK for secure storage of key-value pair based data

Local Notifications:
Notifications are par for the course on most mobile devices.
Notifications are the easy way of drawing the attention of the mobile device user to any event or any information that you may wish to deliver to the user.
Indeed, notifications are extensively used by most mobile applications.
In this module, we'll examine the use of local notifications, how your app can generate a local notification, then put that into the notification bar on your device.
Now, we're not talking about push notifications.
Push notifications require server-side support.
The server should be able to push the notification.
But ultimately, when the notification is pushed to your device, your device will still put a local notification into the notification bar.
In this lesson, we'll examine the use of local notifications and how we can use Expo SDK to be able to generate and put a local notification into the notification bar of your mobile device.
So, putting the local notification into the notification bar of your device is a standard use case in most mobile applications.
Now, this is where you need to leverage the native devices capabilities for being able to put the notification.
So, a notification is typically, as I said, used for reminding the user of some information.
Notification support from Expo SDK provides you access to both remote notifications, also known as push notifications, and also local notifications.
You can even schedule local notifications to be put at a specific time.
Say, for example, you are developing an application where you need to remind the user at a specific time.
As an example, you are developing an application that reminds the user to exercise every single morning.
Then, every single morning, you may wish to schedule to put a notification into the notification bar reminding the user that they are supposed to exercise that day for at least 30 minutes.
Well, it's beside the point whether the user actually exercises or not, but at least the mobile app will do its duty in reminding the user just like a typical spouse.
That's one example of where you can use local notifications.
Similarly, if you're using a calendaring-based application, you may wish to remind the user of a prescheduled event from that calendar and so on.
Also, maybe there are situations where something happens within your application, and then you may wish to alert the user about this issue, and so on.
So, in this lesson, we'll look at, for example, when the user submits a request for reserving a table at our restaurant, then we will put a notification into the notification bar to remind the user that their restaurant reservation request has been submitted.
Now, you could also put a notification after the restaurant confirms the reservation, but that would be more of a push notification rather than a local notification.
So, how do we generate local notifications in your React Native application using the Expo SDK?
So, there are several methods that Expo support for local notifications provides.
It provides you with a presentLocalNotificationAsync method which takes the local notification JavaScript object as a parameter, and puts the local notification.
You can schedule a local notification supplying the notification object, and then also the scheduling options as another JavaScript object.
You can dismiss an already generated local notification by specifying the localNotificationId.
When you put a local notification, then it'll return an ID for the notification that is put into the notification bar.
Then, you can use that to go and delete the notification from the notification bar.
There are situations where you may wish to do that in your application.
The localNotification object itself, JavaScript object itself, has these properties.
It takes a title, a body, a data.
So, these are the three things that you would expect in a local notification.
The sound, if you are putting it on either Android or iOS, you can supply the sound as a parameter.
So, the sound will be generated when the local notification is put.
Then, typically, the notification sound that you select on your device will be sounded when the notification is put into the notification bar.
On Android, you can even specify an icon to be used, the color of the notification to be used, a priority for the notification to be used,
whether the notification should be sticky, meaning that it cannot be dismissed from the notification bar,
whether you wish to vibrate the device when the notification is put there, any link to your app that you want to put in your notification.
All these can be supplied as parameters, but these are useful only in an Android device.
Now, with this quick understanding of how you can generate local notifications,
let's take a look at an example of how local notifications are going to be used within our application.
Going to our application, as we recall, we had generated the reserve table function earlier.
Now, when I submit a request for a reservation like this, so let me select a date and a time, and then submit a reservation request,
and keep a watch on the notification bar, and then you will immediately see a notification being put in the notification bar.
So, when you drag down the notification bar, you would notice a new notification added by our application into the notification bar here.
So, that is an example of the use of local notifications within our application.

Exercise (Instructions): Local Notifications

Objectives and Outcomes
In this exercise you will configure your app to make use of notifications support from Expo SDK.
You will then generate local notifications.
At the end of this exercise you will be able to:
1.Configure your app to use notification support from Expo SDK

In this exercise, we're going to create a Local Notification when the user submits the reservation form
and then put that information into the Notification Bar of our device.

Local Notifications:
  First install:
    expo install expo-permissions
    expo install expo-notifications
  Open ReservationComponent.js and update it.
  Save all the changes and do a Git commit with the message "Local Notifications".

Conclusions
In this exercise you learnt to configure your app to use notifications support from Expo SDK and generate local notifications.

Social Sharing:

1.Set up the your application to use MailComposer
2.Configure your application to open an email composer window with some information filled-in when the user clicks a button

Sending Email:
  First, install expo-mail-composer as:
    expo install expo-mail-composer
  Then open ContactComponent.js and update it
  Save all the changes and do a Git commit with the message "Sending Email".

Conclusions
In this exercise you configured the MailComposer from Expo SDK to enable your app to send email

Exercise (Instructions): Social Sharing
Objectives and Outcomes
In this exercise you will use the React Native Share API to enable your application to share information to your social media accounts.
At the end of this exercise you will be able to:

1.Set up the Share API
2.Configure your application to share information to your Social Media accounts by using react-native "Share" API

1.Social Sharing
  Open DishdetailComponent.js and update it.
  Save all the changes and do a Git commit with the message "Social Sharing".

Conclusions
In this exercise you used the Share API to enable social sharing in your app

Picking an Image:
Objectives and Outcomes
In this lesson you will learn to use the Expo SDK ImagePicker API to enable your application to obtain an image to use within your application.
At the end of this exercise you will be able to:
1.Use the ImagePicker API from Expo SDK
2.Enable your application to obtain an image from the camera

In this exercise, we'll look at the use of the image picker that enables us to capture a picture from the camera, or even select from the devices gallery or the photo album on our device.
In this exercise we will explore the use of the image picker from Expo to be able to capture the image using the camera.
In the assignment you will explore the use of the image picker for selecting an image from the gallery or the photo album on your device.
In addition, in this exercise we will also learn how to make use of the bottom tab navigator from React navigation to set up tabbed navigation.
To get started on this exercise, let's now go to that login component.
And in the login component, I will set it up such that it will have a tabbed navigation setup in there.
And then also enable me to show, as you recall they have already created the login form here. We will also create one more form here for user registration.
And in the user registration form, we will provide an option for the user to be able to upload an image of the user to their profile that later on we will later on we will be able to store on their server side.

Exercise (Instructions): Picking an Image:
Objectives and Outcomes

In this exercise you will use the ImagePicker API from Expo SDK to access the camera to obtain a picture for use in our app.
At the end of this exercise you will be able to:
1.Configure your app to use the ImagePicker

Conclusions
In this exercise you will use the ImageManipulator API to modify the image.

Network Info:
Objectives and Outcomes
In this lesson you will use the NetInfo API from React Native to access network information. At the end of this lesson you will be able to:
1.Use the NetInfo API to obtain network information
2.Respond to changes in the network information

Exercise (Instructions): Network Info
Sometimes the mobile device may lose connectivity, and maybe the user turns off the network connectivity of the mobile device.
So, when your application is running, you may wish to detect all these changes to the connectivity of the device,
and then from within your application if you expect to have a connection to be able to do the operations within your application,
then you should be able to handle any changes to the network connectivity appropriately within your application.
This is where the Network Info API from React Native is useful to detect changes to the network connectivity.
The network connectivity on mobile devices can be unpredictable at times, and you can easily lose connectivity depending on where you are at any given point of time,
and even as a function of time, and place you may have or not have connectivity to the network.
So, you need to be able to check dynamically for any changes to the network connectivity, and then appropriately respond to those changes.
Maybe within your application you may support an offline operation, or at least provide access to a limited set of capabilities within your application when the device is offline,
and then when the device gets reconnected to the network may be you will synchronize any changes that the user makes within the app to a server where the data is persisted, and so on.
So, all these need to be handled appropriately within your application.
This means that you should be able to detect network information, and any changes to the network information.
How do we do that in our React Native application?
The network information aspect in a React Native application can be obtained through the NetInfo API that React Native supports.
This exposes the information about the online and offline status of your device.
The connection type for your device will be specified typically in terms of none, WiFi, cellular and unknown.
An effective connection type could be specified even further by saying it's a 2G connection, a 3G connection, a 4G connection, or a unknown connections.
The Network Info API supports methods like addEventListener which will allow you to listen to an event.
And the typical event that you listen to is the connectionChange event.
So, when you register a handler for a connectionChange event, the handler itself will be notified of any changes to the network connection.
Within the handler, you will be delivered with two piece of information, the Connection Type and the EffectiveConnectionType.
 So, checking on the ConnectionType and EffectiveConnectionType, you can then recognize what kind of a connection you have.
So, if the ConnectionType says none, that means that you have lost internet connectivity, if the connection type is WiFi that means that you are connected to the WiFi network, if it is connected to a cellular network then the ConnectionType will be set to cellular, and so on.
So, your handler will receive this information, and then you respond appropriately.
Now, typically, when you're leaving your application you would normally remove the EventListener.
The EventListener should be listening only when your app is running on the device, when your app exits then you should stop listening to the events appropriately,
because otherwise you will be wasting the battery on the device unnecessarily.
You can call this method called getConnectionInfo to get the initial connection info on the device.
You can even check to see if the connection is expensive.
So, maybe certain operations you may not allow the user to perform them on expensive network connectivity like for 4G and so on.
Maybe you will expect the user to have a WiFi connection before you allow them to be able to access these things,
because these days the mobile network operators charge you an arm and a leg for even one megabyte of data.
So, you may wish to not allow access to, or downloading large amounts of data when you are connected through a mobile network,
but instead wait for a Wi-Fi connection before you proceed ahead with the upload, or download of large amounts of data.
So, all these can be easily checked using the NetInfo object.
In the exercise in this lesson, we will look at the use of the various methods from the NetInfo API to be able to respond to changes in the network information.

Objectives and Outcomes
In this exercise you will use the NetInfo API from React Native to access network information. At the end of this exercise you will be able to:
1.Use the NetInfo API to obtain network information
2.Respond to changes in the network information

1.Network Info
  expo install @react-native-community/netinfo
  Open MainComponent.js and update it.
  The ToastAndroid for showing message on the screen only works for android.
  Find another equivalent for ios.
  Save the changes and do a Git commit with the message "Network Info".

Conclusions
In this exercise you use the NetInfo API to obtain network information and then respond to changes in network connectivity

Assignment 4:
Accessing Native Capabilities of Devices: The Expo SDK:
The final assignment concentrates on Expo SDK and the use of the API for accessing the native device capabilities.
You can find the links to these API in the additional resources.
In this assignment you will enhance the application to use an image from the photo library on your device using the ImagePicker API.
Also, you will access the device calendar and add an event to it from the app.

This assignment consists of two tasks:

Task 1

In this task you will make use of the Expo SDK ImagePicker API to enable your application to fetch an image from the photo library.

Update LoginComponent.js to set up a function named getImageFromGallery() that fetches the image from the photo library on the device using the ImagePicker API support. Details of setting up the source to be the Photo Library can be found in the API documentation.
Add a new button named Gallery that when clicked will initiate the process to enable the user to select a picture from the photo library using the ImagePicker API.
Once the image is picked, it must be processed through the ImageManipulator to obtain a resized PNG version of the image as we did in the exercise.
Task 2

In this task you will insert a new Calendar event into the default calendar on the mobile device for the table reservation. You will use the Calendar API from Expo SDK for this. You will implement this in the ReservationComponent.js file.

When the user submits the reservation form, you will obtain the details of the reservation in the handleReservation() function.
Implement a new function named obtainCalendarPermission() that will ask for permission to access the calendar on the device. The corresponding permission is Permission.CALENDAR.
Implement another function named addReservationToCalendar() that receives the date information as a parameter. This function is invoked from the handleReservation() function.
You should use the createEventAsync() function from the Calendar API to insert the event into the default calendar (Calendar.DEFAULT). This function takes a title, the start and end time, timezone and location as the parameters.
Use 'Con Fusion Table Reservation' as the title of the inserted event
To specify the start Date and end Date, you can convert the Date ISO string into a Date object by using new Date(Date.parse(date)). Furthermore, the Date.parse() gives you the date value in milliseconds. You can set up the end time by adding 2 hours (2*60*60*1000) to the milliseconds and use it to generate the Date object corresponding to the end time of the event.
For time zone use 'Asia/Hong_Kong', and the location as '121, Clear Water Bay Road, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong'

Building and Deployment:

Objectives and Outcomes
In this lesson you will learn about Webpack and how react-scripts uses webpack to package your React application to create a distribution folder.
At the end of this exercise you will be able to:


1.Understand the Webpack way of packaging applications into bundles
2.Use react-scripts to build a distribution folder with your React application bundled using Webpack

Buildingn and Deployment:
Building Standalone Apps:
Now that we have completed building the React Native Application,
you will be curious about how you can build your Application and then deploy it to the iTunes Store or the Google Play Store.
Now, for this, you need to build the Android APK file or the iOS IPA file.
Now, Expo provides many resources for us online and online services that enable you to automatically build these for you without having to install Xcode or using Android Studio.
So, in this exercise, we're going to pursue that approach for building an application using the Expo's online services.
To make use of the online services from Expo, we need to sign up for an Expo account.
Now, before we do that, we first download and install the XDE desktop tool that is available from Expo.
The XDE provides a Expo development environment. That is also another way of getting started with a React Native Application instead of using the Create React Native App that we have used in this course.
Now, both will lead you to the same point as I will explain in short while later.
Now, the first step for you to do is to download the XDE and install it on your computer for the specific OS from the links given.
In this XDE, you can register for an Expo account by clicking on the register link there and then fill in your details and then sign up for a account.
Now, once you complete that process, then you can sign into your account using this Sign In Window here.
Then you will get to this screen here and then for your React Native project that you've already created, you can simply open that using Expo XDE.
The Create React Native App project that you've created also is set up such that it can be easily opened in XDE.
Now, once your project is up and running, you can click on the "Share" button and you'll see the QR code
and you can scan this QR code using your Expo App and you'll be able to access your React Native Application on your device directly from here.
So, once you have completed this, then to build the APK files or the IPA files, you need to use the Expo Command-Line Interface called as exp.
So, you need to install that command line interface : sudo yarn global add exp
So, once you have completed that, then the next step is to download icon that we will use for our application
The icon that you will see in the launcher screen for your Android device or in your iOS device.
So, download the icon.png file that is provided in the exercises resources for this particular exercise and then move that icon.png file into the projects folder.
Now, once you have completed that, then open the package for JSON file and then make sure that the name here is typed as "confusion".
We must have set this up when we created our project and also open this file called app.json and then in the app.json file, this is what you will find already configured in the app.json file. To this file, add in these few configurations here. So, I will type the name as "confusion", because that's exactly what we are using the package for JSON file.
So, the same name should be used in this app.json file. So, we'll configure the name and then we'll configure the icon as "./icon.png".
then we'll set up the version. Currently, we are doing the 1.0.0 version. So, that's the version that we're setting up here and then we'll set up something called slug.
The slug gives the name that is going to be used in your Expo account to identify this particular project.
So, in your Expo account, when you give this name as "confusion", the project will be identified as expo.io@username/confusion.
Then in addition, we need to configure two more properties called as iOS.
For iOS, we will configure a property called as bundleIdentifier.
This is something that the iOS uses when it builds the application and the normal bundle identifier that we would use is the reverse of the domain name for our company, and the specific application.
Again, that is up to us to decide what to use.
So, let me add a net.food.confusion.confusion.
Again, depending on your company's domain name, you would configure this appropriately.
Similarly, for Android, they would supply what is called as the package name and so this would be supplied here as package.
Now, if you have done any iOS and Android development, you would understand the package names and all these things that are used by Android studio or Xcode for iOS.
So, that is what you will configure in the app.json file.
Once, you have configured this, then, it is time for us to build our a React Native Application and then, build the corresponding APK file.
Now, in this exercise, I'm going to demonstrate how to build the Android APK file.
For iOS also, there will be a similar process.
The instructions are given in the link that is provided in the exercise resources for how to build for iOS.
I'm just going to demonstrate how to do this for Android.
So, let me go ahead and save the app.json file.
Before we go ahead and understand how this whole thing works, again in the expo documentation, you will find a link to a tool of the XDE.
So, you can go through this link to understand how the XDE is used in in expo development.
Let me quickly draw your attention to the project lifecycle. This sort of explains to you how this whole development is actually taking place.
So, in Expo, what we are doing is that if you use Expo XDE, you will set up a new project using Expo XDE.
That is one way of arriving at the stage where you will be developing your project local.
The other alternative way of arriving at this point is to use the Create React Native App that we have installed.
So, both of these parts will land you at the same point where you will begin with the scaffolded out application that is already set up with all the toolings necessary for you, and so that you can develop your project locally.
Once you have developed your project, then you will publish your project to the server.
Now, a part of doing this is already done when we configure the app.json file there, and then we'll do the exp build which is the way we will build our APK or our IPA files here and then when you build the APK or IPA files,
then you're ready to deploy it to the item iTunes Store or the Google Play Store.
Now, the other part detaching to Expokit.
I will talk about it a little bit later.
Now so, in this exercise we're going to go through this step of using exp build to make use of the Expo's online services to build the APK file for our application.
So, how do we do that? Going back to the terminal.
At the terminal prompt, since we have already installed exp, let me just verify that I have installed exp here,
yes indeed exp is installed and it is available at my command prompt.
You may need to restart your terminal window or command prompt.
Now look for the exp, the command line tool to be available at the prompt.
So, I have already restarted by terminal window, so I have exp available at the prompt.
So, to build our Android APK file at the prompt, you simply type exp build:android, and then, you will let the Expo builder go through the process of building up.
It's going to ask you a few questions after which it will set up and build the APK file on the Expo's servers and then make the APK file available for you to download.
So, let's go ahead and start the build and this is going to take quite some time for it to complete its work and again, you have to make sure that you have set up the project correctly.
You can ignore these warnings, that's not going to cause much issue for us and then, it will go through a certain set of steps, and then build up our application.
So, as you can see it is building up the JavaScript bundle first, and then once that is done, then it will go to the next step.
It is building the Android bundle at this moment, so we'll let it go through its steps
and then it'll start up its building, and you would see a couple of links provided here.
Now, this is the link where your application is available.
So, you can go to this link and then you will see this your application on the Expo's server and this link that is provided here is where it will show you the building process as it is going through,
and this will take quite some time for it to complete.
So, you have to wait patiently for quite a few minutes or perhaps sometimes an hour in order for this to complete the build.
So, be very patient, and make sure that you don't lose your internet connection while this is going on.
So, while the build is going on, I have brought you over to the link that is provided there's and you can already see that the icon has been taken up by my application
and so, this is where you will contain the details of your application
and then, as you can see, you can scan this QR code to be able to access the application from the Expo server so this will be a public distribution of your application that you can provide for other people to access your application.
So and then, if you go to this link there, you would find that your projects, your snacks, favorites, all these are available here.
Again, you need to sign up for an Expo account for you to be able to access these.
Similarly, I'm going to take you to the other link that is provided.
The build's link that is provided for us, and you can see that right there, it is printing out all this information on the screen here to show what is going on behind the scenes
and as you can see, it's going to take a lot of time before the build is completed,
so you have to wait for this to complete and when this is completed,
then you will be able to download from the link here or your link will be printed out on the screen.
So, you'll be able to view the information there.
So, you can see what all has been done by Expo for building your application.
Again, this may not make much sense to you but if you are curious,
you can watch and see what is going on behind the scenes as as your application is being built,
and once it finally completes, you will see the completed checkbox here and then you will see the download link here.
Similarly, when you go to the terminal, you will see the message here saying successfully built a standard on app
and then you will get this URL here which is exactly the same as the download link that you have seen here.
So, using either one of these, you can download the APK file that has been built for us by Expo's online service.
So, let's go ahead and download this APK file.
Once I downloaded file, then copy the file into my Android device and then went ahead and installed the file on my Android device,
and you can see that my new application is now installed on my Android device.
So let me go ahead and start the application.
Now, when you start the application, then you will see that the application starts up and then starts showing the information.
Now again, make sure that your json server is up and running on your computer because your application is going to be making use of the json server to obtain the data from the json server in order to show the information within your application.
So, this is the version of the application that has been compiled by the Expo server and then installed on my computer.
So, you can see that the application works exactly like our regular application, no difference between this and the app that we have been serving up from our Create React Native App.
The process for doing this for iOS is pretty similar with some minor changes and the details of how to do it for an iOS device are in the link that is provided in the exercise instructions,
that will take you to the Expo's documentation where the details are given.
Similar steps are followed in order to generate the IPA file for iOS.
We have demonstrated how we can make use of the Expo servers to build our APK file, install it on our device,
and then use it in our application.
So this APK file is ready for distribution in Google Play Store.
With this, we complete this exercise.
In this exercise, we have seen how we can use the Expo's online services to build and deploy our application to a device.

Exercise (Instructions): Building Standalone Apps
Objectives and Outcomes
In this exercise you will learn about how you can use the Expo support to build and deploy your apps to the iTunes and Google Play store using their online services.
You will understand that this process requires no set up of XCode or Android Studio, and can be done from a Mac, Windows or Linux machines.
At the end of this exercise you will be able to:

1.Set up Expo XDE and install the Expo CLI named exp and use them to build and deploy your application
2.Configure your React Native application and then use the online services from Expo to build the Android APK for deployment to the Google Play store


Expo XDE, CLI and Expo Account:
1.Download and install Expo XDE as per the instructions given here in this link:
  Start Expo XDE and sign up for an account on Expo.
  You will need an Expo account in order to do the building of the Android APK or iOS IPA files.
  Then, install the Expo CLI, named exp as shown below:
    sudo yarn global add exp@54.0.1
        or
    sudo npm install -g exp@54.
    Don't forget to add sudo in front of the commands on Mac and Linux
    Then, download the icon.png file given above, and put it in the project's root folder.

2.Open the app.json file in the project's root folder and update it

{
  "expo": {
    "sdkVersion": "27.0.0",
    "name": "confusion",
    "icon": "./icon.png",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "slug": "confusion",
    "ios": {
      "bundleIdentifier": "net.food.confusion.confusion"
    },
    "android": {
      "package": "net.food.confusion.confusion"
    }
  }
}
3.Building the Android APK
  This link provides the details on how to build your app for both Android and iOS.
  To build your Android APK, type the following at the prompt:
    exp build:android
  Similarly you can build the iOS IPA using "exp build:ios".
  More specific configurations for iOS build are given in this link.
    https://docs.expo.io/distribution/building-standalone-apps/?redirected
  Once the build is completed (after waiting patiently for a long time), then you can download the APK file from the link that will be provided for you by Expo.
  You can then copy the APK file to your Android device and install it.
  Alternately if you already have Android Developer tools set up and know how to use adb, then you can just run "adb install <your APK File>".

Conclusions
  In this exercise you learnt to build and deploy your Android APK for your project.
